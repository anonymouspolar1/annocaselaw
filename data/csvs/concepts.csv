NOTE: emergency apparent on facts, but not discussed in this judgement since it was concerned with whether a duty existed, not whether the plaintiff had acted in an emergency."

0260,https://cite.case.law/nm/69/394/ ,Ayban,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,Marginal because case effectively simply states duty of building owner to business invitee—and the fact that that duty does not change whether or not a warning has been given prior to entry to the premises—but does not establish that facts of the case indicate negligence

A few weeks later, while recovering, plaintiff swallowed a toothpick and had surgery to remove this. During plaintiff’s postoperative recovery, plaintiff received five enemas. He subsequently had a heart attack, which he claimed resulted from the stress caused by the multiple anemas. The trial court barred the plaintiff’s expert’s testimony and granted summary judgment in favour of defendant. The appellate court reversed the decision to bar plaintiff’s expert’s testimony, and held that given the conflicting expert testimony, summary judgment was inappropriate."
